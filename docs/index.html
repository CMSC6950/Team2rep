## Objective

Growing degree days (GDD) are values used in phenology measuring total heat accumulation in a region, in order to predict rates of development in  plants or animals. Using the historical climate data available from the Government of Canada, this project aims to create a coherent workflow leading to the calculation and analysis of GDD for a number of Canadian cities.

## 1. How do plants grow?

Plants require a number of things in order to grow: sunlight, 
water, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients. Though sunlight does provide the energy 
needed for plants to undergo photosynthesis, their development and maturation 
is also largely dependant on daily ambient temperatures.

## 2. Understanding growing degrees

Growing degree days (GDD) are a way to monitor the total heat 
accumulated by the plant through the ambient temperature, over a 
period of time. 

Many species will only hit development milestones 
after a certain accumulated amount of heat, so GDD can be used to 
keep track of the heat that has been available in a region over time.

GDD proves an important tool for biologists, horiculturists, and agriculturers, 
allowing them to predict things like crop harvest dates, 
nutrient timing, or even dates when insects will emerge.

## 3. Calculating GDD values
Growing degrees are defined as the number of degrees the average daily 
temperature is, above a set base value (Tbase). This base value is 
usually defaulted to 10 C, though each species may have a more 
accurate value, and signifies the temperature below which no growth 
will occur. If the daily average happens to be below T<sub>base</sub>, the GDD 
value for that day is set to zero.

To calculate GDD, using daily max. and min. temperatures:

Accumulated GDD can be determined by summing the daily GDD values for a range of time.
