\begin{abstract}
Growing degree days (GDD) are values used in phenology measuring total heat accumulation in a region, in order to predict rates of development in  plants or animals. Using the historical climate data available from the Government of Canada, this project aims to create a coherent workflow leading to the calculation and analysis of GDD for a number of Canadian cities.
